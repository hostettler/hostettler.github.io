    <link href="http://hostettler.github.io/blog/2012/06/10/Sessions-GC-Conversations/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-10T18:51:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://hostettler.github.io/blog/2012/06/10/Sessions-GC-Conversations</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of days ago, I had a discussion with a developer about the notion of web conversation.
More precisely, about its utility. During this discussion, we ran into some basic misconceptions
that, IMHO, no web developer must do. Conversation (or flows) are good features of the recent
frameworks (Spring, JSF) because they allow to save information across several user requests without
putting them into the session. For instance, this can be very useful for wizards. Putting these
information into the session asks for manual maintenance, and in particular for manual collection.
This is usual error prone and should be avoided. The problem being that the user rarely logs out
before closing the browser. Thus, <code>HttpSession.invalidate()</code> does not get a chance to be called
and the session remains active until the timeout occurs (usually 20 minutes later).</p>

<p>The person I was talking with, though that it is not necessary to care about that. In his view,
the garbage collector will take care of this and that it can be forced. We discuss the matter a bit
deeper and here are some myths that I think must be rebutted.</p>

<h2>First assumption: I can force the garbage collection</h2>

<p>This is not true, actually according to the Java documentation:
<code>
Calling the gc method suggests that the Java Virtual Machine expend effort toward recycling unused objects in order to make the memory they currently occupy available for quick reuse. When control returns from the method call, the Java Virtual Machine has made a best effort to reclaim space from all discarded objects.
</code></p>

<p><code>System.gc()</code> <strong>suggests</strong> the garbage collection, it does not enforce it. This signals that you
would like the garbage collector to do its job, but there is no guarantee whatsoever. It is only
possible to enforce garbage collection by writing your own garbage collector, but you cannot expect
all garbage collectors of all the possible VM to act similarly. Therefore, relying on this
assumption is not portable.</p>

<h2>Second assumption: If I close the browser the session and its objects are collected</h2>

<p>Even If it would be possible to enforce the garbage collection, it is of no use as long as there
remains a single reference to the objects to collect. Again, this is absolutely not the case.
Remember that closing the browser does not mean anything to the server. It would, in theory possible
to imagine something with an ajax call that traps the close event of the browser and does a
<code>HttpSession.invalidate()</code> . This is quite complex to do in a cross-browser manner and gives no
guarantee. Therefore, the data attached to the session will be kept in memory until the session
timeout. This is precisely the beauty of conversation scopes, the developer just tells when the
conversation starts and when it ends. Usually, user do not stop in the middle of a conversation,
they tend to finish it. At least, more often that they click on logout.</p>

<h2>Third assumption: Anyway this does not represent a huge amount of memory.</h2>

<p>Let us take a simple example: a standard business application that, at some point in the business
process, requires a tree for shop selection. This kind of interactions requires several client-server
communications and therefore several requests. A temptation would be to put the tree in the session
scope. Let us say that 10,000 (logical) users log into the application, for instance from 09:00 am to 09:30
am. If each session requires 100 KB (trees are huge even with lazy loading), we end up with 1G memory(only for the tree).
As most of the users do not click on logout, you rely on the timeout to free these objects.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Using request scope of conversation scope over session scope is a good practice as it frees you
from managing the garbage collection. The code is therefore cleaner and more efficient.
This can be done with JSF's <code>@ConversationScoped</code> or with Spring Webflow's <code>Conversation</code>.</p>

    <link href="http://hostettler.github.io/blog/2012/05/24/moxy/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-24T19:17:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://hostettler.github.io/blog/2012/05/24/moxy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Object-Relational mapping is around for a while and its last incarnation, JPA 2.0, is easy to use
yet powerful and adapted to most of the real-life situations. A problem that is similar to
Object-Relational mapping (ORM) is Object-XML mapping (OXM). More precisely, it aims at mapping XML
schemas to JAVA classes. JAXB (JSR 222) specifies how to maps classes to xml schemas.
In this post, I demonstrate the ease of use of this approach using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/moxy.php">MOXy</a>. MOXy is the Eclipse implementation of JAXB and I found it really easy to use.</p>

<p>As always let us first look at the Maven dependencies:
```xml Maven dependencies for using MOXy
<repositories></p>

<pre><code>    &lt;repository&gt;
        &lt;id&gt;EclipseLink Repo&lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;EclipseLink Repository&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;url&gt;http://download.eclipse.org/rt/eclipselink/maven.repo&lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;/repository&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></repositories></p>

<p><dependencies></p>

<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.eclipse.persistence&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;eclipselink&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.3.2&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p></dependencies>  <br/>
```</p>

<p>Eclipse-link provides an implementation for JAXB. The rest is in the JEE 6 SDK.</p>

<p>In this post I only consider the case in which we have control over the schema.
In this case, it is sufficient to annotate the fields and the classes you want to marshall to XML.
Let us use the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jee6-demo/">JEE-6-Demo</a> project that can be found on Google
Code. The following snippet shows a simple model that represents a student.</p>

<p>As you can see there are few annotations. The first one <code>@XmlRootElement</code> simply declares what the  root element is. The second annotation specifies the mapping policy. We will come back on that later. The fields are either not annotated or annotated with @Transient. In the first case, they
are marshaled if not null and in the second they are simply ignored. The only tricky part is that transient fields (in the Java sense) are ignored. For instance, this is the case of the <code>gender</code> property.</p>

<p>```java A simple mapping from object to XML
@XmlRootElement
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)
public class Student implements Serializable {</p>

<pre><code>private Long id;

private String lastName;

private String firstName;

private Date birthDate;

@XmlTransient
private PhoneNumber phoneNumber;

private transient Gender gender;

@XmlTransient
private Address address;

@XmlTransient
private List&lt;Grade&gt; grades;

...

@XmlTransient
private Badge badge;
...
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Let us now test the mapping. The code below, creates a new <code>Student</code> and fills the associated
fields. The second part of the snippet marshals the object into XML and streams it to <code>System.out</code>.</p>

<p>```java Creation of student and its marshaling to XML</p>

<pre><code>Student student = new Student("Lion Hearth", "Richard", new Date());
Address address = new Address();
address.setCity("Carouge");
address.setNumber("7");
address.setPostalCode("1227");
address.setStreet("Drize");
student.setAddress(address);
Badge b = new Badge();
b.setSecurityLevel(30L);
b.setStudent(student);
student.setBadge(b);
student.setPhoneNumber(new PhoneNumber(0, 0, 0));
for (Discipline d : Discipline.values()) {
    Grade g = new Grade(d, 10);
    student.getGrades().add(g);
}

JAXBContext jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(Student.class);       
Marshaller marshaller = jaxbContext.createMarshaller();
marshaller.setProperty(Marshaller.JAXB_FORMATTED_OUTPUT, true);
marshaller.marshal(student, System.out);
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Finally, the result looks like the XML below. As you can see, it is pretty easy and straight-forward
to produce XML from a Class description. Most of the fields that have been populated are not
marshaled to XML. This is due to the <code>@XMLTransient</code> annotation that tells JAXB not to consider
them for output.</p>

<p>```xml Marshaled version of the previous Student object.
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<student></p>

<pre><code>&lt;lastName&gt;Lion Hearth&lt;/lastName&gt;
&lt;firstName&gt;Richard&lt;/firstName&gt;
&lt;birthDate&gt;2012-06-04T11:12:34.751+02:00&lt;/birthDate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></student>
```</p>

<h3>Mapping Overview</h3>

<p>The previous example was as simple as possible. Obviously, sometimes it is important to be able to
tweak the mapping. Let us look at some simple mapping options.</p>

<h4>Element naming</h4>

<p>The default mapping rule is to use the field name as XML element name. This policy can be overridden
by the <code>@XmlElement(name = ...)</code> annotation. Applying the annotation <code>@XmlElement(name="last_name")</code> on the <code>lastName</code> field of the previous example would result in:
```xml Example of named element
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<student></p>

<pre><code>&lt;last_name&gt;Lion Hearth&lt;/last_name&gt;
&lt;firstName&gt;Richard&lt;/firstName&gt;
&lt;birthDate&gt;2012-06-04T11:12:34.751+02:00&lt;/birthDate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></student>
```</p>

<h4>Attributes vs elements</h4>

<p>By default fields are marshaled as XML elements. It is possible to ask JAXB to transform them to
XML attributes by using <code>@XmlAttribute</code> annotation. Putting <code>@XmlAttribute</code> on the <code>lastName</code>
field of the previous example would produce the following XML:
```xml Example of using an attribute instead of an element
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<student lastName="Lion Hearth"></p>

<pre><code>&lt;firstName&gt;Richard&lt;/firstName&gt;
&lt;birthDate&gt;2012-06-04T11:12:34.751+02:00&lt;/birthDate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></student>
```
Please note that as for an element, the attribute name can be customized.</p>

<h4>Mapping strategy</h4>

<p>As mentioned before, the default mapping strategy is declared by using the <code>@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.*)</code> annotation.</p>

<p>There exists four mapping policies. For more details, look at the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/xml/bind/annotation/XmlAccessType.html">Javadoc</a> for <code>XmlAccessorType</code>. Here is an excerpt
from the Java doc.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>FIELD</code>: Every non static, non transient field in a JAXB-bound class will be automatically bound to XML, unless annotated by XmlTransient.</li>
<li><code>NONE</code>: None of the fields or properties is bound to XML unless they are specifically annotated with some of the JAXB annotations.</li>
<li><code>PROPERTY</code>: Every getter/setter pair in a JAXB-bound class will be automatically bound to XML, unless annotated by XmlTransient.</li>
<li><code>PUBLIC_MEMBER</code>: Every public getter/setter pair and every public field will be automatically bound to XML, unless annotated by XmlTransient.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Name spaces</h4>

<p>An important aspect of XML is its modularity. In particular, namespaces bring a nice way to organize
the XML and the schemas. Namespaces can be specified at different levels. For more details look at the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/UserGuide/MOXy/Type_Level/Setting_Up_Namespace_Information">MOXy documentation</a>. For now, it is sufficient to known that the <code>@XmlType</code>, <code>@XmlElement</code>, and <code>@XmlAttribute</code> annotations support a namespace attribute.</p>

<h3>One to one mapping</h3>

<p>Now that we have mapped simple field, let us look at more complex mappings. First, a 1-1 mapping.
The following example maps an address.</p>

<p>```java Add a one to one mapping
@XmlRootElement
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)
public class Student implements Serializable {</p>

<pre><code>...

private Address address;
</code></pre>

<p>}
<code>
To that end, it is sufficient to add the following annotations to the Address type.
</code>
@XmlRootElement(name = "address")
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)
public class Address implements Serializable {</p>

<pre><code>...
/** house number. */
private String number;

/** the name of the street. */
private String street;

/** the city name. */
private String city;

/** the postal code. */
private String postalCode;
...
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>And the rest is handled by JAXB to produce the following result.</p>

<p>```xml
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<student></p>

<pre><code>...
&lt;address&gt;
    &lt;number&gt;7&lt;/number&gt;
    &lt;street&gt;Drize&lt;/street&gt;
    &lt;city&gt;Carouge&lt;/city&gt;
    &lt;postalCode&gt;1227&lt;/postalCode&gt;
&lt;/address&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></student>
```</p>

<h4>Bi-directional one to one</h4>

<p>The next example is more tricky. The problem with bi-directional mapping is that they produce
graphs. Of course, since XML are trees, we must avoid cycles. The solution is to annotate the reverse mapping (<code>Student student</code> in this case) with <code>@XMLTransient</code> causing the property to be ignored by JAXB.</p>

<p>```java Add a one to one bidirectional mapping
@XmlRootElement(name = "student")
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)
public class Student implements Serializable {</p>

<pre><code>...

private Badge badge;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The following type describes the <code>Badge</code> that has a reverse mapping to <code>Student</code>.
<code>`java Mapping of the type</code>Badge``
@XmlRootElement(name = "badge")
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)
public class Badge implements Serializable {</p>

<pre><code>/** The unique id. */
private Long id;

/** The student's security level. */
@XmlAttribute
private Long securityLevel;

/** The student that owns this badge. */
@XmlTransient
private Student student;
</code></pre>

<p>```
And finally, here is the result.</p>

<p>```xml Result of the bi-directional mapping
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<student></p>

<pre><code>...
&lt;badge securityLevel="30"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></student>
```</p>

<h3>One to many mapping</h3>

<p>One to many mappings are handled automatically. There is nothing special to do. In our example,
removing the <code>@XmlTransient</code> annotation on the <code>grades</code> property will generate the following output:</p>

<p>```xml One to many example
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<student></p>

<pre><code>&lt;last_name&gt;Lion Hearth&lt;/last_name&gt;
&lt;firstName&gt;Richard&lt;/firstName&gt;
&lt;birthDate&gt;2012-06-05T10:57:36.699+02:00&lt;/birthDate&gt;
&lt;phoneNumber&gt;+00-0000-0000&lt;/phoneNumber&gt;
&lt;address&gt;
    &lt;number&gt;7&lt;number&gt;
    &lt;street&gt;Drize&lt;/street&gt;
    &lt;city&gt;Carouge&lt;/city&gt;
    &lt;postalCode&gt;1227&lt;/postalCode&gt;
&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;grades&gt;
    &lt;discipline&gt;MATHEMATICS&lt;/discipline&gt;
    &lt;grade&gt;10&lt;/grade&gt;
&lt;/grades&gt;
&lt;grades&gt;
    &lt;discipline&gt;BIOLOGY&lt;/discipline&gt;
    &lt;grade&gt;10&lt;/grade&gt;
&lt;/grades&gt;
</code></pre>

<p> ...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;badge securityLevel="30"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></student>
```</p>

<h2>Custom mapping</h2>

<p>Sometimes, it is difficult to map a given type to a given XML structure. This is the case of the <code>PhoneNumber</code> type in our example. To that end, it is possible to define a <code>XMLJavaTypeAdatper</code>
that will convert XML to object and objects to XML manually. The adapter is not very difficult to implement. It is composed of two methods that respectively unmarshal from XML and marshal to XML.</p>

<p>```java
public class PhoneNumberAdapter extends XmlAdapter&lt;String, PhoneNumber> {</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public PhoneNumber unmarshal(final String value) throws Exception {
    return PhoneNumber.getAsObject((String) value);
}

@Override
public String marshal(final PhoneNumber value) throws Exception {
    return PhoneNumber.getAsString((PhoneNumber) value);
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
<code>
Then, it is required to annotated the property with this adapter:
</code>java Using a custom XML-Object Adapter</p>

<pre><code>...
@XmlJavaTypeAdapter(PhoneNumberAdapter.class)
private PhoneNumber mPhoneNumber;
...
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This will produce the following result:
```xml
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<student></p>

<pre><code>&lt;last_name&gt;Lion Hearth&lt;/last_name&gt;
&lt;firstName&gt;Richard&lt;/firstName&gt;
&lt;birthDate&gt;2012-06-05T10:57:36.699+02:00&lt;/birthDate&gt;
&lt;phoneNumber&gt;+00-0000-0000&lt;/phoneNumber&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p></student>  <br/>
```</p>

<h2>What about XML schemas</h2>

<p>As mentioned previously, we assumed that you have total control over the schema. Nevertheless, it can
be useful to be able to produce this schema. This is done by the following snippet.</p>

<p>```java Output the underlying schema
SchemaOutputResolver sor = new SchemaOutputResolver() {</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public Result createOutput(final String namespaceUri,
        final String suggestedFileName) throws IOException {
    Result result = new StreamResult(System.out);
    result.setSystemId("System.out");
    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>};
jaxbContext.generateSchema(sor);
```</p>

<h2>Write XML</h2>

<p>Writing XML is fairly easy, just populate the objects that you want to marshal and then
use the following code:
<code>java How to marshal a given object
JAXBContext jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(Student.class);       
Marshaller marshaller = jaxbContext.createMarshaller();
marshaller.setProperty(Marshaller.JAXB_FORMATTED_OUTPUT, true);
marshaller.marshal(student, System.out);
</code></p>

<h2>Read XML</h2>

<p>The reverse operation is as easy and straightforward (provided that use the same schema):
<code>java How to unmarshal a given XML file to objects
InputStream stream = StudentOXTest.class.getResourceAsStream("/student.xml");
JAXBContext jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(Student.class);
Unmarshaller unmarshaller = jaxbContext.createUnmarshaller();
Student student = (Student) unmarshaller.unmarshal(stream);
</code></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We have seen how to use MOXy to map objects to XML. Using JAXB annotations, it is very easy to read and write XML. The examples used in this blog are to be found in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jee6-demo/">JEE-6-Demo</a> project on <a href="http://code.google.com">Google code hosting</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://hostettler.github.io/blog/2012/05/02/a-jee6-security-interceptor-for-tomcat-7/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-02T18:23:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://hostettler.github.io/blog/2012/05/02/a-jee6-security-interceptor-for-tomcat-7</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Security in Java EE is a well-known subject and JAAS, the framework that manages security, is
stable and reliable. Nevertheless, its API is quite low level and not always very convenient. For
that reason, there exist a number of frameworks that have been built on top of JAAS that provide
nice abstractions and convenient tools. This is especially true for the JEE application servers such as <a href="http://glassfish.java.net/">Glassfish</a>, <a href="http://www.jboss.org/">JBoss</a> and the like.</p>

<p>In servlet containers such as <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a> or <a href="http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/">Jetty</a> however, only the web components are secured and it is not trivial to secure services and the data access layer. This can be solved by integrating framework such as <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/">Spring Security</a>, <a href="http://shiro.apache.org/">Apache Shiro</a>.</p>

<p>As always it is not always possible to put a new framework or library in place. I will not
discuss whether it is a good or a bad idea to develop a new security mechanism. Nevertheless, a good
rule of thumb is to reuse existing components and not reinvent the wheel ... when possible. If for
let's say licensing reasons, it is not possible: here is a way to provide a simple declarative
authorisation procedure based on JAAS and the JEE6 interceptors. The objective is to propagate the
authorisation to non-web layers such as services or data access layer through a thread-local
variable.</p>

<p>The goal is to be able to write something similar to the following snippet. The idea is to annotate
a method (or a class) with a list of roles that are authorised. If the method executes in a context
in which a user has not enough rights, it raises an exception.</p>

<p>```java Example of a service layer protected by JEE6 interceptor
@Secure(roles = { "user" })
public List<Student> getAll() {</p>

<pre><code>...
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>@Secure(roles = { "admin" })
public void add(final Student student) {</p>

<pre><code>...
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<h3>Java Authentication and Authorisation System</h3>

<p>Java Authentication and Authorisation System (JAAS) provides a security infrastructure for JAVA.
Both <strong>authentication</strong> (are you who you pretend to be?) and <strong>authorisation</strong> (are you allowed to do something you would like to do?) are covered. JAAS relies on the concept of principal.
A principal is a particular identity of a user (e.g. social security id, driver licence id, ...).
By default, in JAVA SE, there is no easy way to have the list of roles granted to a given user.
To solve that problem, we need a bean that knows to which role a given Principal is authorised.
This is the role of <code>MyPrincipal</code>.</p>

<p>```java A custom principal that contains the roles
public class MyPrincipal implements Principal, Serializable {</p>

<pre><code>public MyPrincipal(final Principal pPrincipal, final List&lt;String&gt; pRoles) {
    this.principal = pPrincipal;
    this.roles = pRoles;
}
...  
public boolean isUserInRole(final String pRole) {
    return roles.contains(pRole);
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<h3>JEE6 Interceptors</h3>

<p>Since JEE6, a feature called interceptors enables simple
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">Aspect Oriented Programming</a> without
using any specific framework. It works, of course, only on managed classes. Namely, classes that are instantiated by <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/giwhb.html">CDI</a> through dependency injection.</p>

<p>Just to fix the vocabulary, here some definition about Aspect Oriented Programming:</p>

<ul>
<li>Advice: code at it executed at a certain point in the code. This point is called a join point;</li>
<li>Join point: place in the code at which a given advice is executed.;</li>
<li>Pointcut: set of join point, usually described by a meta data that can be internal or external to the program (xml, annotations);</li>
<li>Aspect: advice + its pointcut;</li>
</ul>


<p>In Java EE6, an interceptor is made of an annotation that characterizes an aspect and an
implementation for that annotation. The annotation is placed at a join point, that is a place in the code where a specific advice must be executed. Usually around a method call. However, JEE6
interceptors are not as powerful as advanced AOP frameworks such as AspectJ, it provides enough
facility to decouple non-functional behaviors from the business code. That is exactly what we want
to achieve here. Let us now illustrate JEE6 interceptors through the implementation of a declarative security annotation that protects calls to the service layer.</p>

<h4>A meta data that asks for security</h4>

<p>The first thing is to declare an annotation that is parametrized by an array of <code>String</code> that
represents roles. This is presented in the following snippet. The annotation <code>InterceptorBinding</code>
is required to mark the annotation as a pointcut. The <code>@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)</code>
declares that Then <code>@Target({ ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.TYPE })</code> tells that the annotation
can be applied at both method level and type level. Finally, the member <code>String[] roles();</code>
declares that the annotation has a parameter called <code>roles</code>.</p>

<p>```java Secure.java
@InterceptorBinding
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target({ ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.TYPE })
public @interface Secure {</p>

<pre><code>@Nonbinding
String[] roles();
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<h4>The interceptor (advice) that check the authorisation</h4>

<p>The next step is to program an advice. To that end, a
simple class must be annotated by the annotation <code>@Interceptor</code> and by the annotation that it
implements <code>@Secure(roles = { })</code> (i.e. the pointcut). The method that is annotated by
<code>@AroundInvoke</code> is executed by the container when it encounters a method annotated by <code>@Secure</code>
(i.e. join point). The name of the method (e.g. <code>invoke</code> ) does not matter as long as it returns an
<code>Object</code> and it accepts an <code>InvocationContext</code> as a parameter. This context contains information
about the intercepted method.</p>

<p>About the method itself, <code>getRoles</code> is a private method (given hereafter) that extract the list
of roles that are authorised to this method. The <code>SecurityContext</code> is described below and is
container for the <code>ThreadLocal</code> variable that contains the principal of the current user. The
method <code>principal.isUserInRoles(roles)</code> returns true if one the roles matches the expected
authorisation. If it is not the case an exception is raised and the interceptor stops there without
having executed the intercepted method. Otherwise, the interceptor goes on and executes the
intercepted method and finally returns its return value by executing <code>return context.proceed()</code> .</p>

<p>```java SecurityInterceptor.java CDI Interceptor
@Secure(roles = { })
@Interceptor
public class SecurityInterceptor implements Serializable {</p>

<pre><code>@AroundInvoke
public Object invoke(final InvocationContext context) throws Exception {
    String[] roles = getRoles(context.getMethod());
    MyPrincipal principal = SecurityContext.getPrincipal();

    if (!principal.isUserInRoles(roles)) {
        throw new IllegalAccessException("Current user not autorised!");
    }

    return context.proceed();
}

private String[] getRoles(final Method method) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The private method getRoles scans the class of the method that has been intercepted in order to
discover the list of roles. First it scans at method level (<code>method.isAnnotationPresent</code> ) to
find the annotation <code>Secure.class</code> that has been described above. If it does not find the proper
annotation then it scans at class level (<code>method.getDeclaringClass().isAnnotationPresent</code> ).
Remember that we allow to put the annotation at the method level AND at the class level.</p>

<p>```java Method that scans the caller for annotation parameters
private String[] getRoles(final Method method) {</p>

<pre><code>if (method.isAnnotationPresent(Secure.class)) {
    return method.getAnnotation(Secure.class).roles();
}

if (method.getDeclaringClass().isAnnotationPresent(Secure.class)) {
    return method.getDeclaringClass().getAnnotation(Secure.class).roles();
}

return null;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The last step to activate the interceptor is to declare it in the <code>beans.xml</code> file. Remember that it works
thanks to CDI and only for the beans managed by CDI. By default, interceptors are disabled.</p>

<p>```xml beans.xml CDI descriptor
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
&lt;beans xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"</p>

<pre><code>xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://jboss.org/schema/cdi/beans_1_0.xsd"&gt;
&lt;interceptors&gt;
    &lt;class&gt;ch.demo.business.interceptors.SecurityInterceptor&lt;/class&gt;       
&lt;/interceptors&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></beans>
```</p>

<h4>How to populate the ThreadLocal variable with principal information</h4>

<p>So far, we did intercept the method call and check whether the current principal associated with
the thread is authorised to access to a the intercepted method. The problem is that in servlet
containers the security is at web level and we would to propagate this information. To that end, we
will use the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage">thread local</a>
variables.</p>

<p>The following class contains a thread-local variable <code>principalHolder</code> that holds the current
(thread-local) principal. This assumes that a thread is processed by one and only one thread from A
to Z. This is the case for servlet engines but not always for application servers. In the latter
case, the vendor-specific security mechanism is much better as it takes things such as clustering
into account. The method <code>setPrincipal</code> is invoked at the beginning of a new request when it is
authenticated and authorised at the web level. <code>removePrincipal</code> cleans up the Thread-Local value
at the end of the request processing.</p>

<p>```java SecurityContext.java Thread-local container for the principal
public final class SecurityContext implements Serializable {</p>

<pre><code>private static InheritableThreadLocal&lt;MyPrincipal&gt; principalHolder = 
            new InheritableThreadLocal&lt;MyPrincipal&gt;();

private SecurityContext() { }

public static MyPrincipal getPrincipal() {
    if (principalHolder.get() == null) {
        principalHolder.set(new MyPrincipal(null, null));
    }
    return (MyPrincipal) principalHolder.get();
}

public static void setPrincipal(final MyPrincipal principal) {
    principalHolder.set(principal);
}

public static void removePrincipal() {
    principalHolder.remove();
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The last step is to populate the principal and its associated roles to the thread-local container
when the request is initialized. For that purpose, we use a request listener that is invoked when a new
request has been submit and just before its destruction. On initialization, the method
<code>getMyPrincipal</code> extracts the principal from the request <code>request.getUserPrincipal()</code>. The
resulting principal is put in the thread-local by <code>SecurityContext.setPrincipal</code>.</p>

<p><code>getMyPrincipal</code> also goes through the list of roles and adds the authorised roles using <code>request.isUserInRole</code> from <code>HttpServletRequest</code>.</p>

<p>```java SecurityListener.java
public class SecurityListener implements ServletRequestListener {</p>

<pre><code>private static List&lt;String&gt; roles = null;

@Override
public void requestInitialized(final ServletRequestEvent sre) {
    SecurityContext.setPrincipal(getMyPrincipal((HttpServletRequest) sre.getServletRequest()));
}

@Override
public void requestDestroyed(final ServletRequestEvent sre) {
    SecurityContext.removePrincipal();
}

public static MyPrincipal getMyPrincipal(final HttpServletRequest request) {
    if (roles == null) {
        roles = getSecurityRoles(request.getServletContext());
    }

    Principal principal = (Principal) request.getUserPrincipal();
    List&lt;String&gt; currentRoles = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
    for (String role : roles) {
        if (request.isUserInRole(role)) {
            currentRoles.add(role);
        }
    }
    return new MyPrincipal(principal, currentRoles);
}

public static synchronized List&lt;String&gt; getSecurityRoles(final ServletContext ctx) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The next method is not very elegant but this is the only way that have found to extract the role
list that is required by the current web application. It parses the <code>web.xml</code>, looking for
<code>role-name</code> elements that describe a role.</p>

<p>```java Extract the role list from web.xml
public static synchronized List<String> getSecurityRoles(final ServletContext ctx) {</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; r = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
InputStream is = ctx.getResourceAsStream("/WEB-INF/web.xml");

DocumentBuilderFactory dbFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbFactory.setNamespaceAware(true);
try {
    DocumentBuilder dBuilder = dbFactory.newDocumentBuilder();
    Document doc = dBuilder.parse(is);
    doc.getDocumentElement().normalize();

    NodeList elements = doc.getElementsByTagName("role-name");
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; elements.getLength(); i++) {
        r.add(elements.item(i).getTextContent().trim());
    }
} catch (Exception e) {
    new IllegalAccessException(e.getMessage());
}
return r;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Finally, the listener is enabled by putting the following lines in <code>web.xml</code>.
```xml web.xml
<listener></p>

<pre><code>&lt;listener-class&gt;ch.demo.web.SecurityListener&lt;/listener-class&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></listener>
```</p>

<p>Whenever there is not redirect (that triggers a new request) after login or there is a manual call to JAAS, the
principal must be manually set into thread-local right after the login. This is because if the
security is checked right after authentication and the listener has already been called (at the beginning of the
request) it has been set to an invalid principal.</p>

<p><code>java
request.login(user, password);
SecurityContext.setPrincipal(SecurityListener.getMyPrincipal(request));
</code></p>

    <link href="http://hostettler.github.io/blog/2012/03/22/one-to-one-relations-in-jpa-2-dot-0/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-22T10:41:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://hostettler.github.io/blog/2012/03/22/one-to-one-relations-in-jpa-2-dot-0</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I came across the need to map a one 2 one relationship from the object model to the database using JPA 2.0.
The case was pretty simple as the database was nicely organized but it raised the question: what if? What if I have to deal to a legacy system or a database administrator that has to follow strict company rules. Other reasons such as security or performances may interfere with simple designs. Hence, I had a look to the diverse ways to map a one 2 one relationship. I probably forgot several cases so please do not hesitate to discuss them in the comments.</p>

<p>A one to one relationship consider that the objects involved in the relation are highly dependent. In Object Orientation, this corresponds to the an aggregation or a composition. In a relational model, the data can be either:</p>

<ol>
<li>in the same table,</li>
<li>split over two (or more) tables (one per object) and linked by a foreign key, or</li>
<li>split over two (or more) tables and linked by a join table.</li>
</ol>


<p>The rest of the articles these describes different situations. Please note that for the sake of the explanation, I explicitly map all the fields even if most of the time the default mapping policy would work.</p>

<h2>Data in the same class: Embedded class</h2>

<p>This is especially useful for legacy code where the database design is a bit to flat for your taste.
The following figure presents the concept of an embedded class. The class <code>Address</code> is embedded in the class <code>Student</code>.
The idea is that <code>Address</code> is an entity per se, it exists only in the context of the class <code>Student</code>.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper center'><img class='caption' src='/figures/one2oneVariante1.png' width='' height='' alt='One 2 One relations as an embedded class' title='One 2 One relations as an embedded class'><span class='caption-text'>One 2 One relations as an embedded class</span></span></p>

<p>To declare a embedded class, the class itself must be annotated with <code>@Embeddable</code> and its reference must be annotated with
<code>@Embedded</code>.</p>

<p>```java A embeddable class
@Embeddable
public class Address implements Serializable {</p>

<pre><code>...
@Column(name = "NUMBER")
private String number;

@Column(name = "STREET")
private String street;
...
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p><code>@Embedded</code> and <code>@Basic</code> cannot be used together. Therefore, if required, lazy fetching must be declared field by field in the embedded class. Remember that outside of a JEE container,  the actual behavior of lazy loading on <code>@Basic</code> and <code>@OneToOne</code> depend on the actual implementation. Eclipse link, for instance, does not perform lazy loading by default on <code>@Basic</code>, <code>@OneToOne</code>, and <code>@ManyToOne</code> mappings. For more detail, please refer to the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Using_EclipseLink_JPA_Extensions_%28ELUG%29#What_You_May_Need_to_Know_About_EclipseLink_JPA_Lazy_Loading">Eclipse-link specification</a>.</p>

<p>```java The class Address is embedded into a Student
@Entity
@Table(name = "STUDENTS")
public class Student implements Serializable {</p>

<pre><code>...

@Id
@Column(name = "ID")
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private Long mId;

...

@Embedded
private Address mAddress;

...
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The following SQL statement shows the code generated by the previous mapping.</p>

<p>```sql SQL code generated according to the previous mapping
SELECT  ID, FIRST_NAME, PHONE_NUMBER, BIRTH_DATE, LAST_NAME, NUMBER,</p>

<pre><code>    CITY, STREET, POSTAL_CODE 
</code></pre>

<p>  FROM  STUDENTS
```</p>

<h2>Data in different classes: Secondary Tables</h2>

<p>In the second scenario, the OO model is composed on only one class but the relational model is split over several tables.</p>

<h3>The foreign key is in the secondary table</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper center'><img class='caption' src='/figures/one2oneVariante2.png' width='' height='' alt='Data is in different tables with the foreign key in the secondary table' title='Data is in different tables with the foreign key in the secondary table'><span class='caption-text'>Data is in different tables with the foreign key in the secondary table</span></span></p>

<p>In this case, the concepts of secondary tables is very useful. A secondary table is basically a table that hosts
important data that are one to one related to the data of the primary table.
Unlike the first case, a join is required and thus a key mapping is required.
In the following mapping, the secondary table <code>PICTURES</code> is mapped using its <code>STUDENT_ID</code> field to the <code>ID</code> field
of the main table.</p>

<p>```java Mapping of the Student entity
@SecondaryTable(name = "PICTURES",</p>

<pre><code>pkJoinColumns = @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name = "STUDENT_ID", 
    referencedColumnName = "ID"))
</code></pre>

<p>public class Student implements Serializable {</p>

<pre><code>...
@Id
@Column(name = "ID")
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private Long mId;

/** A picture of the student. */
@Lob
@Basic(optional = true, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
@Column(table = "PICTURES", name = "PICTURE", nullable = true)
private byte[] mPicture;
...
</code></pre>

<p><code>`
The following SQL statement shows the code generated by the previous mapping.
It joins the two tables according to the</code>@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn`` annotation.</p>

<p>```sql SQL code generated by the previous mapping
SELECT  t0.ID, t1.STUDENT_ID, t1.PICTURE, t0.FIRST_NAME, t0.PHONE_NUMBER, t0.BIRTH_DATE,</p>

<pre><code>    t0.LAST_NAME, t0.NUMBER, t0.CITY, t0.STREET, t0.POSTAL_CODE 
</code></pre>

<p>  FROM  STUDENTS t0, PICTURES t1
 WHERE  (t1.STUDENT_ID = t0.ID)</p>

<p>```</p>

<h3>The foreign key is in the host table</h3>

<p>Similarly to the previous case, the data is split over several tables. The difference lies in the foreign key position.
Here the foreign key is hosted in the primary table.
<span class='caption-wrapper center'><img class='caption' src='/figures/one2oneVariante3.png' width='' height='' alt='Data is in different tables with the foreign key in the primary/host table' title='Data is in different tables with the foreign key in the primary/host table'><span class='caption-text'>Data is in different tables with the foreign key in the primary/host table</span></span></p>

<p>From a mapping point of view, it is very similar to the previous case. Indeed only the key column names have to be changed
to reflect the organization.</p>

<p>```java Mapping of the Student entity
@SecondaryTable(name = "PICTURES",</p>

<pre><code>pkJoinColumns = @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name = "PICTURE_ID", 
    referencedColumnName = "PICTURE_ID"))
</code></pre>

<p>public class Student implements Serializable {
```</p>

<p>The following SQL statement shows the code generated by the previous mapping.
Again, the data are joined according to the content of the <code>@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn</code> annotation.</p>

<p>```sql SQL code generated by the previous mapping
SELECT  t0.ID, t0.PICTURE_ID, t1.PICTURE_ID, t1.PICTURE, t0.FIRST_NAME, t0.PHONE_NUMBER, t0.BIRTH_DATE,</p>

<pre><code>    t0.LAST_NAME,t0.NUMBER, t0.CITY, t0.STREET, t0.POSTAL_CODE 
</code></pre>

<p>  FROM  STUDENTS t0, PICTURES t1
 WHERE  (t1.PICTURE_ID = t0.PICTURE_ID)
```</p>

<h2>First and second class JPA citizens</h2>

<p>In the previous examples, the table <code>PICTURES</code> does not have a business existence in itself. It is a secondary table because its data only have meaning in relation to the data of the primary table. Sometimes, we may want to treat the second objects as first class JPA citizens and thus we must put the <code>@Entity</code> annotation on it. In this case, we have to use the <code>@OneToOne</code> annotation for the mapping. Unlike the previous mappings, <code>@OneToOne</code> enable bidirectional mapping.</p>

<p>In the last example, the tables <code>STUDENTS</code> and  <code>BADGES</code> have a one to one relationship modeled with a foreign in the <code>BADGES</code> table to the <code>STUDENTS</code> table. In this case, the owning side is the <code>Badge</code> entity has it contains the foreign key.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, the class <code>Badge</code> is now an entity has it has a business existence without <code>Student</code>.  The interesting part is the <code>@JoinColumn</code> annotation that specifies the local column that is the foreign key (<code>STUDENT_ID</code>) as well as to which column of the foreign table its corresponds (<code>ID</code>).</p>

<p>```java Mapping of the Badge entity
@Entity
@Table(name = "BADGES")
public class Badge implements Serializable {</p>

<pre><code>...

@Id
@Column(name = "ID")
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private Long mId;

@Column(name = "SECURITY_LEVEL")
private Long mSecurityLevel;

@OneToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "STUDENT_ID", referencedColumnName = "ID")
private Student mStudent;

...
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>As we want the other side to be aware of the relation (bidirectional), it is required to add the <code>mappedBy</code> attribute to the <code>@OneToOne</code> annotation. This attribute references the (Java) property in the entity that is the owner of the relationship.</p>

<p>```java  Mapping of the Student entity
@Entity
...
public class Student implements Serializable {</p>

<pre><code>...
@Id
@Column(name = "ID")
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private Long mId;


/** The Student's badge. */
@OneToOne(mappedBy = "mStudent")
private Badge mBadge;
...
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Using the previous mapping, JPA 2.0 produces the following SQL statements to load the Student object.
```sql
SELECT t0.ID, t1.STUDENT_ID, t1.PICTURE, t0.FIRST_NAME, t0.PHONE_NUMBER,</p>

<pre><code>   t0.BIRTH_DATE, t0.LAST_NAME, t0.NUMBER, t0.CITY, t0.STREET, 
   t0.POSTAL_CODE 
</code></pre>

<p>  FROM STUDENTS t0, PICTURES t1
 WHERE (t1.STUDENT_ID = t0.ID)</p>

<p>SELECT ID, SECURITY_LEVEL, STUDENT_ID
  FROM BADGES
 WHERE (STUDENT_ID = ?)
```</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>JPA 2.0 offers many way to represent one to one relationships. This flexibility allows to handle many different scenarios that may happen when integrating legacy databases.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Testing JPA components in Java SE has been greatly simplified since JEE6.
Nevertheless, it is still not as simple as testing other components.
Although there exist some frameworks such as <a href="http://www.jboss.org/arquillian">Arquillian</a> that solve that problematic,
it is sometimes to much of hammer to test a couple of entities and simple services.
Here is a post in which I digest some other posts and my own experience of how to test JPA components. The following example is part
of a Demo project I use to teach the JEE stack that is located on Google Code Hosting and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jee6-demo/">JEE-6-Demo</a>
This project relies on <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven 3</a> for build and dependency management. It does not use EJBs (at least for now) and thus it can be deployed in a Servlet engine.
Please note, that to me the kind of tests we are doing here are not unit tests (though we use JUnit ). Actually, as a database is required,
these  are integration tests.</p>

<p>Let us assume that we want to test that the following model has been properly annotated and can be persisted according to a given DB schema:
``` java An annotated entity that represent a student
// Get the entity manager for the tests.
@Entity
@Table(name = "STUDENTS")
public class Student implements Serializable {</p>

<pre><code>private static final long serialVersionUID = -6146935825517747043L;

@Id
@Column(name = "ID")
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private Long mId;

@Column(name = "LAST_NAME", length = 35)
private String mLastName;

@Column(name = "FIRST_NAME", nullable = false, length = 35)
private String mFirstName;

@Column(name = "BIRTH_DATE", nullable = false)
@Temporal(TemporalType.DATE)
private Date mBirthDate;
</code></pre>

<p>}
<code>
with the following persistence unit:
</code>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
&lt;persistence version="1.0"</p>

<pre><code>xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence"&gt;
&lt;persistence-unit name="JEE6Demo-Persistence"

&lt;/persistence-unit&gt;

<p>We use <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/">Eclipse-link</a> as it is the reference implementation for JPA 2.0
```xml Eclipse-Link dependencies</p>

        &lt;version&gt;2.0.0&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;/dependencies&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Since JEE 6, it is easy to start the JPA manager in a unit test. Let us look at the following listing. The first two lines initialize the persistence manager given a persistence unit. The name of the persistence unit must matched the declared persistence unit in <code>META-INF/persistence</code>. After what, the try block gets a transaction and starts it. The object student is persisted and the transaction is committed. If anything goes wrong, the transaction is roll-backed. Finally, the entity manager and the factory are closed.
``` java Start the JPA manager manually
// Get the entity manager for the tests.
EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("JEE6Demo-Persistence");
EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
try {
   //Get a new transaction
   EntityTransaction trx = em.getTransaction();</p>

<p>   //Start the transaction
   trx.begin();
   //Persist the object in the DB
   em.persist(student);
   //Commit and end the transaction
   trx.commit();
} catch (RuntimeException e) {
   if (trx != null &amp;&amp; trx.isActive()) {</p>

<pre><code>  trx.rollback();
</code></pre>

<p>   }
   throw e;
} finally {
   //Close the manager
   em.close();
   emf.close();
}
```</p>

<p>There are several open issues problems with this code:</p>

<ol>
<li>We do want to use a local in memory database. Indeed, we do not want to mess up with the information stored on the Mysql database. Finally, we need the test to be as autonomous as possible. That is that it does not depend on an external server (e.g. app server, database server).</li>
<li>JUnit does not guarantee the order in which the tests are ran.
Therefore, we must initialize the manager before each and every test of the fixture. Furthermore we must close it after the test to
avoid session leaks.</li>
<li>During tests, we must make sure that the database is in an acceptable state before running each unit.</li>
</ol>


<p>To limit the dependencies to other components and to keep the setting simple, we will use <a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/">Derby</a> as a pure in
memory database. That is no file produced during the database execution and thus no cleaning afterwards. Please note that is only used for testing purposes.</p>

<p>```xml Derby in memory database dependencies
<dependency></p>

<pre><code>&lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.derby&lt;/groupId&gt;
&lt;artifactId&gt;derby&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;version&gt;10.8.2.2&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></dependency> <br/>
<dependency></p>

<pre><code>&lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.derby&lt;/groupId&gt;
&lt;artifactId&gt;derbyclient&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;version&gt;10.8.2.2&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></dependency>
```</p>

<p>The following <code>persistence.xml</code> file sets  <code>DERBY</code> as a target database language. Using Derby, selecting the embedded
drivers in conjunction <code>org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver</code> with a <code>jdbc:derby:memory</code> URL runs a database in memory without
persisting anything to disk. This combination is important as it otherwise will store file on the disk.
The following will be used by <code>Maven</code> during the test because it overrides the one in `/main/resources/META-INF/``. This is an elegant way to use a different database setting for the unit tests.
``` xml Persistence descriptor /test/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<p>To solve the second issue, we must guarantee that each test fixture gets a fresh entity manager. JUnit 4+ executes whatever
public static method annotated with <code>@BeforeClass</code> before firing up the class constructor. Similarly, methods annotated with <code>@AfterClass</code>
are executed after all the tests and is therefore a good place for cleanup.
``` java Start the JPA manager before for each test fixture</p>

<p>/<strong> The factory that produces entity manager. */
private static EntityManagerFactory mEmf;
/</strong> The entity manager that persists and queries the DB. */
private static EntityManager mEntityManager;</p>

<p>@BeforeClass
public static void initTestFixture() throws Exception {</p>

<pre><code>// Get the entity manager for the tests.
mEmf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(mPersistenceUnit);
mEntityManager = mEmf.createEntityManager();
...
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p> /<em>*
 * Cleans up the session.
 </em>/
@AfterClass
public static void closeTestFixture() {</p>

<pre><code>mEntityManager.close();
mEmf.close();
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The problem with the pure in-memory approach is that schema has to recreated for each run. One solution would be to rely on the <code>Eclipse-link</code> DDL creation. I do not really like this solution as it usually not accepted by the customers that tend to want to have control
of their schema. Thus, to have a test setting that is as close as possible to the production setting we need something to install the schema
by running a SQL file. There are many solutions out there:</p>

<ul>
<li>Manually parsing the SQL file. I do not like this solution as it becomes rapidly intractable when the file contains comments and transactions.</li>
<li>Using tools such as <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/">Liquibase</a>. Nice solution but to me it was to much of a hammer to that specific case.</li>
<li>Using an API that does it for me.</li>
</ul>


<p>I propose the last approach by using <code>Derby Tools</code> and in particular the API of <code>ij</code>.
```xml DBUnit dependency
<dependency></p>

<pre><code>&lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.derby&lt;/groupId&gt;
&lt;artifactId&gt;derbytools&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;version&gt;10.8.2.2&lt;/version&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></dependency>
```</p>

<p>This allows to use <code>ij</code> directly in the test to parse the DDL file. This is shown in the following listing.
First, it gets the underlying JDBC connection and then it run the file located in <code>test/resources/sql/</code>.</p>

<p>```java
@BeforeClass
public static void initTestFixture() throws Exception {</p>

<pre><code>// Get the entity manager for the tests.
mEmf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(mPersistenceUnit);
mEntityManager = mEmf.createEntityManager();

Connection connection = ((EntityManagerImpl) (mEntityManager
        .getDelegate())).getServerSession().getAccessor()
        .getConnection();

ij.runScript(connection,
        AbstractDBTest.class.getResourceAsStream("sql/studentSchema.ddl"),
        "UTF-8", System.out, "UTF-8");
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The third item asks for a way to properly initialize the data prior to the test. Remember that your tests should not rely on the success of
previous ones. To that end, we cleanup the data prior any test execution. A rather easy way to do that is to use
<a href="http://www.dbunit.org/">DBUnit</a>.</p>

<p>```xml DBUnit dependency</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.dbunit&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;dbunit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.4.8&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><code>
It loads a file named `/test/resources/students-datasets.xml`` from the test resources.
</code>java Initialize the test dataset</p>

<pre><code>@BeforeClass
public static void initTestFixture() throws Exception {
// Get the entity manager for the tests.
mEmf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(mPersistenceUnit);
mEntityManager = mEmf.createEntityManager();

Connection connection = ((EntityManagerImpl) (mEntityManager
        .getDelegate())).getServerSession().getAccessor()
        .getConnection();

ij.runScript(connection,
        AbstractDBTest.class.getResourceAsStream("sql/studentSchema.ddl"),
        "UTF-8", System.out, "UTF-8");

    mDBUnitConnection = new DatabaseConnection(connection);
    //Loads the data set from a file named students-datasets.xml
    mDataset = new FlatXmlDataSetBuilder().build(Thread.currentThread()
            .getContextClassLoader()
            .getResourceAsStream("students-datasets.xml"));

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>After what, clean test data are inserted for each and every test of the fixture:</p>

<p>```java init of the test</p>

<pre><code>@Before
public void initTest() throws Exception {
    //Clean the data from previous test and insert new data test.
    DatabaseOperation.CLEAN_INSERT.execute(mDBUnitConnection, mDataset);
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>In this post, I've showed how to test the persistence of an JPA 2.0 entity using JUnit 4. The test setting runs in memory without external server  and enforces a clean database state prior running the tests.</p>

<p>To support my teaching activities on Java EE 6, I've setup a project on Google Code Hosting that contains all the presented sources and much more. Please give me feedbacks on how to improve that demo project and in particular its
testability.</p>

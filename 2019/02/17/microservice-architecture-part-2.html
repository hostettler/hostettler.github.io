  Microservice Architecture - Part 2 (SSO, Logging, and all that)
  
    <small>17 Feb 2019</small>
  
</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://www.hostettler.net/2019/02/17/microservice-architecture-part-1.html">part 1</a>, we discussed how to compile and deploy the microservices. Remember that the microservices themselves are only a part of the microservice architecture. 
By its very nature, microservice architecture are distributed and that comes with a lot of benefits and some constraints.
One of these constraint is that all the non-functional features such as security, logging, testability and so on, have to take distribution into account.
Think of the microservice architecture as a city, where the microservice are people working in the city. In the city, you also need policemen, firefighters, teachers, healthcare providers to keep it up and running.
The higher the number of people working in the private sector (a.k.a., microservices), the higher the need for non-operational people (a.k.a., utilities)</p>

<h2 id="compile-the-ui">Compile the UI</h2>
<p>This sample microservice architecture does not focus much on the UI. It mainly serves the purpose of showing how to integrate
it with the rest of the architecture. We will not dive into details. Sufficient is to say, that the example was built with <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 7.0</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin">ngx-admin dashboard</a>.
In development, UI is compiled by  and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> running on top of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">nodejs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="compose-the-microservices">Compose the microservices</h2>

<p>At this point, we have all the necessary components. Let’s put everything together by starting the different docker compositions. The order in which we start the compositions is 
important as there are dependencies:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose-microservices.yml</code> starts the <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> message brocker and the microservices. This is what we already tested in <a href="https://www.hostettler.net/2019/02/17/microservice-architecture-part-1.html">part 1</a> to prove that all the microservices are available.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose-log.yml</code> starts an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack">ElasticSearch, LogStash, and Kibana (ELK) suite</a> alongside a Logspout compagnon container to take care of logs. This aggregates <strong>ALL</strong> logs from all containers
and concentrate them into the ElasticSearch using Logstash. Kibana can then be used to analyze the logs and extract some intelligence, raise alerts and so on.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose-api-gw.yml</code> starts an api-gateway that routes the calls to the services and handle 
security by delegating authentication to a identity manager called <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/">keyloak</a>. It also serves static content and as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_termination_proxy">TLS termination</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dissecting-the-docker-composes">Dissecting the docker-composes</h2>
<p>As stated previously <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code> composes several containers together to deliver a solution. 
For instance, by starting the database first and then whatever service that requires a database.
Using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">docker-compose</a> you set the same parameters, environment variables, 
volumes that you would when starting a container with the command line.</p>

<p>From a general point of view, a docker-compose yaml file defines a series of services (e.g., database, microservice, web server) and then a series of “shared” services such as volumes, networks and so on.</p>

<p>Let’s take the example of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose-api-gw.yml</code>  file.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First <code class="highlighter-rouge">version "2.1"</code> defines the version of the syntax. Then <code class="highlighter-rouge">services</code> defines a section with a series of services.</li>
  <li>In the below example, the first service is called <code class="highlighter-rouge">kong-database</code> and is based on a postgres database version 10 as stated by <code class="highlighter-rouge">image: postgres:10</code>. The name of the container (for instance what
will appear if you run <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker ps</code>) is <code class="highlighter-rouge">kong-database</code>. The hostname will also be called <code class="highlighter-rouge">kong-database</code>.</li>
  <li>After that, comes a section that describes the networks the container is participating into. This is very useful to isolate the containers from one another from a network perspective.</li>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">environment</code> section defines environment variables (similar to <code class="highlighter-rouge">-e</code> in the command line).</li>
  <li>The healthcheck section defines rules to state whether or not a container is ready for prime time
and heathly.</li>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">kong-database</code> example does not expose ports but it could so by defining a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ports</code> section that list the mapping of the ports of the container to the port of the host system. <code class="highlighter-rouge">80:7070</code>  means
the the port <code class="highlighter-rouge">7070</code> of the container is mapped to the port <code class="highlighter-rouge">80</code> (http) of the host system.</li>
  <li>Finally, the volumes section maps volumes from the host systems to directory in the container. This is very useful to save the state of the container (e.g., database files)
or to put custom configurations in place.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<p>With that very quick introduction to <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code> let’s have a look at the services delivered by the three <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code> files of the demo:</p>

<h4 id="docker-compose-logyml-providing-a-logging-infrastructure"><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose-log.yml</code>: Providing a logging infrastructure</h4>
<p>Microservice architecture are distributed by nature and therefore cross-cutting concerns such as logging must take that aspect into account and aggregate the logs of the different containers.
Without that it would be difficult to follow a user request that goes accross many services to deliver the final value.</p>

<p>To implement it, we rely on the <a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout">logspout</a> log router. Logspout primarly captures all logs of all the running containers and route them to
a log concentrator. Logspout in itself does not do anything with the logs, it just routes them to something. In our case, that something is <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash">Logstash</a>.</p>

<p>Logstash is part of the ELK stack and is a pipeline that concentrate, aggregate, filters and stashes them in a database, usually <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">elasticsearch</a>.
Kibana depends on Elasticsearch and gets its configuration from a volumes shared from the host (<code class="highlighter-rouge">./elk-pipeline/</code>).
For more details about the Logstash configuration, please refer to <code class="highlighter-rouge">./elk-pipeline/logstash.conf</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elastic Search</a> stores, indexes and searches large amount of data. Like Logstash, it is distributed in nature.
Elasticsearch is starting first in <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose-log.yml</code> because other services such as Logstash and Kibana depends on it.
Elasticsearch maps a host volume (<code class="highlighter-rouge">esdata1</code>) to its own data directory (<code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/share/elasticsearch/data</code>). Thanks to that mapping, data are not lost when the container is stopped or if it crashes.</p>

<p>The final part of the puzzle is <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana">Kibana</a> which visualizes the data stored in Elasticsearch to do business intelligence on the logs. This is very 
useful to get a clear and real time status of the solution. Kibana depends on Elasticsearch and exposes its interface to the port <code class="highlighter-rouge">5601</code> of the host.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="docker-compose-api-gwyml--prodiving-api-gateway-services"><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose-api-gw.yml</code> : Prodiving api-gateway services</h4>
<p>Microservice architecture are usually composed of a lot of services. Keeping track of these, providing and maintaining a clear API becomes very quickly challenging.
Besides, the granularity of microservices often call for a composition to deliver actual added value. Besides, different might have different needs. For instance, a mobile app might need a different API
that a web app.
Furthermore, we often want to secure some services. For instance, using <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">oauth2 protocol</a> connected to an identity provider to offer Single Sign On (SSO) on the services.</p>

<p>In our case, the API gateway is called <a href="https://konghq.com/solutions/gateway/">Kong</a> and it requires a database. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose-api-gw.yml</code> describes the following services:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">kong-database</code> which is a postgress database version 10 that holds the API gateway configuration</p>

<p>The api gateway itself <code class="highlighter-rouge">api-gateway</code> that is based on a docker image that we built previously <code class="highlighter-rouge">unige/api-gateway</code>  when we ran <code class="highlighter-rouge">mvn clean install -Ppackage-docker-image</code> at the root of the project.
To get more details on how the image has been built, look at the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Dockerfile</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">api-gateway/src/main/docker</code> directory. The image is based on <code class="highlighter-rouge">kong:1.1rc1-centos</code> but it is customized in several ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is an additional <a href="https://github.com/nokia/kong-oidc">plugin</a> to support openid</li>
  <li>A customized <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-entrypoint.sh</code> to start Kong as root so that we can attach it to ports <code class="highlighter-rouge">80</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">443</code> that are privileged.</li>
  <li>A customer <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx</code> template to enable serving static content (the UI).</li>
  <li>A shell script called <code class="highlighter-rouge">config-kong.sh</code> that configures the API-gateway by defining the services and the routes to these services. By the way this file, is ran after the api-gateway is
started and labelled as healthy by the container called <code class="highlighter-rouge">api-gateway-init</code>.
The first line defines a service called <code class="highlighter-rouge">counterparty-service</code> that will route the request to the microservice <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://counterparty-service:8080/counterparties</code>. The servicer <code class="highlighter-rouge">counterparty-service</code> is the host name
given by the microservice configuration. The second line creates a route in the API-gateway to the previous service. In that case <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/v1/counterparty</code>, please note that the api-gateway can
take care of versioning. Finally, the last line configures the OpenId plugin to provide authentication by telling the plugin to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">api-gateway</code> client of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">apigw</code> realm of the keycloak.</li>

<p>A database for Keycloak the SSO software called <code class="highlighter-rouge">iam-db</code></p>

<p>The SSO service <code class="highlighter-rouge">iam</code> that is based on Keycloak v4.8.3. Please note that a complete configuration is loaded initially using <code class="highlighter-rouge">master.realm.json</code>. This configuration creates the required
realm, client and configuration to provide authentication to the api-gateway.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="docker-compose-microservicesyml--micro-services-and-message-brocker"><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose-microservices.yml</code> : Micro-services and message brocker</h4>
<p>Finally, the last of the composition are the microservices themselves. As you can see, most of the configuration is not required for the microservices themselves but for the infrastructure around it.
All the services belong to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">backend-network</code> nertwork.</p>

<p>First, it defines a <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/">ZooKeeper</a> that provides distributed configuration management, naming and group services. Zookeeper maintains its state in two shared volumes that are respectively mapped
to the  <code class="highlighter-rouge">./target/zk-single-kafka-single/zoo1/data</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">./target/zk-single-kafka-single/zoo1/datalog</code> directories of the host. Zookeeper is a mandatory component for the message broker.</p>

<p>Second, it defines a Kafka container. <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> is a robust and fast message broker that excels at exchanging messages in a distributed way. It has a dependency to Zookeeper
and exposes its port <code class="highlighter-rouge">9092</code> to the same port on the host. It also saves its state on a mapped volume on the host.</p>

<p>Then, the counterparty service is a actual microservice (Finally !!!) that exposes its port <code class="highlighter-rouge">8080</code> to the port <code class="highlighter-rouge">10080</code> of the host. This microservice is based on <a href="https://thorntail.io/">Thorntail</a>.</p>

<p>The instrument service is special as it connects to the message broker (Kafka) to send messages that will be read later on by the valuation service.</p>

<p>The other microservices : valuation-service and regulatory-service are more of the same.</p>
